# TelemetrySystem
Telemetry system for electric race car

This work was part of my final year project for my undergraduate degree in Electrical/Electronic Engineering in DIT/TUD. Course code at the time: DT021/A.
It is a nearly complete, basic telemetry solution for a car. It only requires a network of sensors on a CAN bus from which it reads data and relays it to
a computer in soft real time.
It consists of a complete computer application and a sketch for an arduino which runs the on-car telemetry.
