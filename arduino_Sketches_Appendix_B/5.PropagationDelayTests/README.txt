These tests were written to try and figure out how quickly data could be sent through the system.
They gave much slower than expected results, from 30mS for 1 way, to 170mS round trip time
including reading, 144bytes. A test with an oscilloscope would have been much more useful,
but none were available due to the college being closed.
