dummyallsignalsbytesV7.ino is the final iteration of the dummySignalsbytes Arduino program
for this FYP - Niall Beggan 2020.

The simplest way to view the telemetry application running is to
connect an arduino with "dummyallsignalsbytesV7.ino" on it to the PC
with a USB cable, and select the arduino in the telemetry application.
