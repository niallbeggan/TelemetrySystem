Moving on from "1.2.ImprovedOneWayCommuncation"
In this example one arduino sends a request.
If the second arduino receives this request,
it replies.

This is the way the telemetry application works
It sends a request, if the arduino reads it,
the arduino sends a reply from the car with
the data from the sensors.
