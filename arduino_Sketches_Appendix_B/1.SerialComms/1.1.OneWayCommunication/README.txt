Serial communication can be confusing

These two simple programs start with the basics.
One arduino communicating with another.

Both arduinos also communicate with the PC. The TX1 RX0 pins are the
same serial line as the mini USB arduino port.

You cannot download a program to the Arduino while something
else is sending data on the serial line.
