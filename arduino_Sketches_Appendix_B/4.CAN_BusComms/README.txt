The CAN section of this project was mostly straightforward,
largely invovling copying of already written code from previous
work.

Raimonds Kaminskis sent his programs to me which were used as
a starting point. As usual there is no one 'FinalFinalFinal'
working version, there is two; One incorporates the Gps,
the other which is much more simple and does not.
